# FHIR® for Researchers

## Overview

Overview:
The goal of this FHIR® for Research site is to equip NIH research scientists and program officers to better leverage FHIR® in their own research by deepening their understanding of where FHIR® data comes from and the FHIR® standard more generally.
For a general review of the FHIR® ecosystem and potential applications, please review the [Introduction to FHIR® for Research webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZwQW0BJJx0).
To complete a series of hands-on exercises on working with FHIR® for research, please review the hands on content below.
To obtain a broad view of Electronic Health Records (EHR), terminology systems, and how United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) and Implementation Guides like US Core enable remote access and interoperability, please continue with [Exercise 4](exercise-4).

## Hands on Content

Exercises are provided in both Python and Java.

## Exercises

## Exercise 0

This hands on exercise introduces learners to the basic mechanisms for working with FHIR® by completing the following steps: establishing a connection to the client server, formatting and submitting a query to the server, processing response data from the FHIR® server, and viewing resulting data to confirm it was successfully pulled from the remote server.


### Exercise 3

Exercise 3 applies knowledge gained in the previous exercises to identify drug-on-drug 
interactions using FHIR® data and NLM APIS. It includes hands on exercises in both 
R and Python.
