# Wrapping up!

**Congratulations on completing this training module. We hope you've found the material educational and informative!**

At this stage our hope is that you feel more comfortable with the following topics:

1. The healthcare data contained in an EHR and some considerations for how to access it.

2. The push for interoperability in Health IT, the challenges, and the various solutions and standards that evolved to meet them, specifically the USCDI standard for information content.

3. Finally, within the FHIR® data exchange standard the role specific implementation guides play to ensure understanding of information that is available, and how one IG, the US Core IG, helps to ensure the comprehensive availability of USCDI standard data.


This material is meant to compliment additional instructional material NIH has created specifically around the FHIR® standard. We encourage you to continue your journey by exploring these additional resources:
