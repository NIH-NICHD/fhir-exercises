## Components:

### Background
* High-level Overview of EHR Technology Ecosystem
    * At its most basic level, an electronic health record (EHR) is a digital version of a patient’s paper medical chart. EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users.
    * EHRs are typically operated by a healthcare practice or system, and consolidate inputs by multiple providers within that system including physicians from differing specialties, nurses, and more that engage with a patient over the time they are receiving care into a single consolidated record.
    * An EHR may include all of the key administrative clinical data relevant to that persons’ care received through the health system, including demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports. 
     *  Additionally, an EHR system is built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care by incorporating data from external care providers, as well as integrating with clinical decision support and other supplemental data sources to enhance an understanding of a patient’s wellbeing.
