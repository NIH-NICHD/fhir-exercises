PRS Release Number: 21-3456

## Getting Started

**System Requirements:**
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Set up a virtual environment (_Optional_)**

It can be helpful to set up a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies from system dependencies.
There are a few libraries that can do this, but this documentation will stick with `venv` since that is included
in the Python Standard Library.

```shell
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

Later on the virtual environment can be deactivated with:

```shell
deactivate
```

**Install dependencies**

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run JupyterLab**

```shell
jupyter-lab
```

By default, this should open Jupyter lab at
